### Setup Instructions

#### System setup
1. Clone the repo with `git clone [REPO_URL]` command
2. Switch to the project's root directory in terminal
3. Install the dependencies by running `yarn install`
4. Once, 'yarn install' is completed, run `exp start` to start the expo and react-native server

Ignore the first step on 'Mobile setup' instructions given below if you already have 'Expo' app installed on your phone.

2. Scan the QR code shown on the terminal.
3. Once the QR code is successfully scanned, it will take few seconds to load and render the app.
